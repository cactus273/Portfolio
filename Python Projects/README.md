# Python Projects
## Falling Squares Matching Game
Creating a rhythm-based matching game with Pygame, similar to Dance Dance Revolution where colorful squares fall from the top of the screen and users must press corresponding arrow keys when squares reach target areas at the bottom. The game features a scoring system with Perfect/Miss feedback, sound effects, and increasing difficulty as the game progresses. Users aim to achieve the highest score and accuracy by timing their key presses precisely with the falling squares.

This project demonstrates **event-driven programming**, **real-time game loops**, **collision detection**, **graphics programming**, and **user interface design**.

## Bejeweled Game with AI Player
Creating a matching game similar to Bejeweled, where within a grid of colored boxes, boxes with the same color are shifted to form a 2x2 group of matching colors and eliminated until none are left. In the diagram below, for example, shifting the green triangle down will form a 2x2 group of green triangles and will thus eliminate the group. On top of creating the mechanics of the game, determining the precedence of actions, and accommodating to edge cases, I also created an AI player that can process a grid and commit the least number of steps to finish the game.

This project demonstrates **game logic algorithms**, **AI decision making**, **grid manipulation**, **optimization strategies**, and **pathfinding algorithms**.

## [Nerdle Game with AI Player](https://nerdlegame.com/) 
Creating a guessing game that is inspired by an existing number version of Wordle called Nerdle. The user inputs an equation to try to guess the secret equation. Seen in the example below, green indicates that the sign or number is correct and at the correct position. Yellow indicates that the number or sign exists within the equation but is not in the correct position. Whereas, grey indicates that the number or sign is not in the secret equation at all. I also created an AI Player that can play the game and guess correctly within an average of 6 guesses (for a 10 digit equation).

This project demonstrates **constraint satisfaction**, **AI search algorithms**, **pattern recognition**, **probability analysis**, and **heuristic optimization**.

## Reach the Target Game
Creating a game where the user (X) is required to navigate through a grid of obstacles to reach the target (T) in the least number of steps. This project was made during the Practical Python Basics Workshop in March of 2023.

This project demonstrates **pathfinding algorithms**, **grid traversal**, **user input handling**, **game state management**, and **shortest path optimization**.
